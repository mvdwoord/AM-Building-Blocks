# AM Building Blocks

A collection of building blocks for RES Automation Manager.

## Reference Modules

Simple reference modules for different languages. Initial setup shows only argument passing, Over the years I have formed some habits in developing various scripting tasks in RESAM which I will document in these reference modules. Initial commit shows only simple variable passing. I like to keep my scripts free of any RESAM specific syntax (parameters / global variables / functions). This allows me to test the code, verbatim, outside of RESAM and increases portability to another automation tool.

## Other

- PortPing 
    Allows you to check for a specific open port, with an optional timeout.
